# RFM Analysis

## What is RFM?

RFM stands for:
- **Recency**: How recently a customer made a purchase.
- **Frequency**: How often a customer makes a purchase.
- **Monetary**: How much a customer spends on purchases.

The goal of RFM analysis is to segment customers into meaningful categories based on these three metrics.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset contains:
- `customer_id`: Unique identifier for each customer.
- `trans_date`: The date on which the transaction occurred.
- `tran_amount`: The amount spent on each transaction.

- **Increase Revenue:**
